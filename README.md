# dirwatch

Watch directories for changes.

Similar to watchtower (but uses JDK 7 async notification mechanisms rather than polling)

Similar to ojo (but simpler, unlimited watchers allowed and directory recursive)

## Installation

Add the following dependency to your `project.clj` file

```clojure
[juxt/dirwatch "0.2.0"]
```


## Usage

```clojure
    (require '[juxt.dirwatch :refer (watch-dir)])

    (watch-dir println (clojure.java.io/file "/tmp"))
```
