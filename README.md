# dirwatch

Watch directories for changes.

Similar to watchtower (but uses JDK 7 async notification mechanisms rather than polling)

Similar to ojo (but simpler, unlimited watchers allowed and directory recursive)

## Usage

    (require '[pro.juxt.dirwatch :refer (watch-dir)])

    (watch-dir (clojure.java.io/file "/tmp") println)
